# BlogReactReduxApp

Simple blog made with made with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

It lists all creates blog posts, shows you details of each post, lets you create new blog article and allows you to delete posts. The goal was to deepen my understanding of react, redux, router and context types.

[redux-form](http://redux-form.com) was used to manage the form state when creating new blog posts.

## A quick look.

This is how the simple blog looks in action:
